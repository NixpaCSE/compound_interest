Hello World! 

This is a web based compound interest calculator that asks the user for:
1. Principal Amount ($)
2. Annual Interest Rate (%)
3. Time (years)
4. Compounding Frequency

The program then calculates the total amount and total interest earned.
It also displays a graph of how your money grows over time!
